# 📈 Week 4 – Multiple Linear Regression & Model Evaluation

In Week 4 of my Data Science learning journey, I focused on building and evaluating a **Multiple Linear Regression Model** to understand how different independent variables influence a target variable. The main goal was to assess model performance and interpret key evaluation metrics.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, I aimed to:

- Understand the intuition behind **Multiple Linear Regression**.
- Train a regression model and interpret its coefficients.
- Evaluate model performance using key metrics:
  - **R² (Coefficient of Determination)** – How well the model explains the variance of the target.
  - **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** – The average magnitude of prediction errors.
- Develop the ability to determine whether a model is “good enough” based on its results.
