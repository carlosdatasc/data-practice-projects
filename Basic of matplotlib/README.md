# Day 3 – Matplotlib Practice (Histograms, Scatter, Boxplots)

This folder contains practical exercises focused on learning **Matplotlib** for data visualization.  
The goal is to practice different types of plots and understand how to interpret them in a Data Science context.

## Contents
- **dataset_ventas.csv** → Simulated dataset used in the exercises.  
- **exercises.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with the solutions to the practice tasks.  


## Key Concepts Practiced
- Histograms → Understanding data distribution.  
- Scatter plots → Exploring relationships between variables.  
- Boxplots → Detecting variability and outliers.  

## Insights
- Prices tend to cluster around medium values.  
- Revenues are skewed, with some very large transactions.  
- Outliers can be easily detected with boxplots and scatter plots.
